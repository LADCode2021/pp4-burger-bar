# PP4 - Burger Bar (Booking app)

Booking is an app designed to make booking a table, changing a book and cancelling a booking at a burger bar easier and more intuitive. The inspiration is taken from a local burger restaurant who on their website asks guests to message them on Whatsapp to book a table. They then manually reply to confirm if they have a table at that time and date. If the guest needs to change their booking, add more people to their booking, add special requests or cancel their booking, then again they have to get in contact via WhatsApp and wait for a manual reply.

Booking achieves the project goal by providing booking page based on principles of design thinking. I empathised with the user by putting myself in their position and anticipated what I think could improve the booking process. I asked myself what would could the site do that would improve the booking process and encourage users to return to the site and therefore the burger bar. I then examined what I would want to see to make me book and return to book again. This process formed my problem statement: "How do I develop a booking application that provides this functionality to the user?"


In terms of functionality users can make a booking (create element of CRUD), see their booking (read element of CRUD), edit their booking (update element of CRUD) or cancel a booking (delete element of CRUD). They must create/login into an account as initial authorisation step for defensive programming reasons and for GDPR reasons so only that person can access their bookings. The app is deployed on Heroku and uses postgresql as its backend database. Other frameworks and packages were used to deliver this app and are detailed towards the end.

# Planning

Following my empathise, questions and examine initial step I started mapping out what I felt was the minimum viable product in agile methodology out the requirements I'd identified in a flow diagram using [Lucid Charts](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/). This allowed me to fully scope what I needed the tool to do and was useful to refer back to, to ensure I was staying on track with the intended minimum outputs for the project.

Please see my original plan below:

![](docs/images/lucid-planning-diagram.jpeg)

I then created a GitHub repository for my app and created a project. Once I'd created the project I setup user stories using automation which automatically added via a template user stories I created to my todo list in the project. I did this so I could track the progress of the functionality I had identified was required for this app.

Please see my initial user stories:

![](docs/images/github-projects-todo-list.png)


I largely stuck to the plan except I decided to update the worksheet all in one API call as the final task, rather than on two separate calls to updated sales first and then the pay calculations later. I read that it is best served to have as few API calls as possible in an application to keep loading/run-time as quick as possible.

Upon failing the initial submission of this project I then added new functionality. The assessor felt that if the user cannot access data in the Googlesheet and if they have to access the Googlesheet to obtain dealer id's then it renders the calculator less useful than just using the Googlesheet. To address this feedback I added functionality to allow the user to access previous sales data. I have changed the the programme so it displays a list of dealer id's in the programme before the user has to choose which dealer. The user should now not need to access the Googlesheet directly for any data input or retrieval.

# How to use Pay Calculator

There are currently 4 imaginary dealers in the Google Sheet used for this project. The calculator requests a choice on how to use the programme on start.

1. Enter either 'a' to view previous sales data or 'b' to enter new sales
    * If 'a' is selected sales data will be displayed and programme will restart
    * If 'b' is selected move onto 2.
2. Enter a Dealer_ID from the list provided into the command line prompt, taking note of type of data the tool will accept.
3. Enter the sales total for that dealer into the command line, again taking note of the type of data the tool will accept.
4. The programme will automatically restart

The outcome of a successful use of the programme will be the command interface showing previous sales data and restarting the programme. Or if the total to pay to the dealer and the total to pay to the house (owner) is displayed and the command line interface confirms data has been added to the Google worksheet and restarts the programme.

# Features

## Existing Features

### Google Sheets

The data for this programme is stored in dealer_details Google sheet. This can be accessed as read-only [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ce3DIRFEajKR9P0evQ10GI1JoCKMAHC_XtExZa5ZjZQ/edit?usp=sharing). There are two tabs, 'dealer' which stores the Dealer_ID and corresponding Dealer_Name which is used in the programme to give a name to an ID for the user. This is so the user has a way to double check they are inputting data for the right person. I chose to do this with an integer ID over just using the name of the dealer as there are better data validation controls with integers. I felt there were too many risks to trying to validate a string. To make this work work I had to import gspread library and Google auth which allowed me to interact directly with Google Sheets.

![](docs/images/dealer-tab.png)

Then there is the 'pay' tab which stores all the outputs from the calculator: 'Dealer_ID', 'Dealer_Name', 'Total_to_pay_dealer', 'Total_to_pay_house' and 'Date_entered. This data is accessible in the programme if the user chooses to view previous sales data by selecting option a.

## Command Line Programme

### Welcome message and User Choice Input

When the programme runs in Heroku a welcome message appears and asks the user to choose between a. viewing previous sales data for a dealer or to input new sales data for a dealer.

![](docs/images/welcome-screenshot.png)

### User Choice Validation

Once the user has entered a choice the programme validates whether it is a valid choice and either displays 'Valid choice' to the terminal or displays a value error and asks the user to try again.

![](docs/images/incorrect-user-choice.png)

### User Input for Dealer ID

Once a valid user choice has been made the programme requests a dealer ID from a list of dealers which is pulled from the Googlesheet and displayed in the terminal.

![](docs/images/dealer-id-input.png)

### Data Validation on Dealer ID User Input

Once the user enters a value into the command line there is some data validation to check that the input is an integer and that it matches a Dealer ID in the dealer worksheet.

If the data is invalid then an error message is printed to the terminal either for invalid integer or incorrect Dealer ID. For example, here is the error message that appears for incorrect Dealer ID:

![](docs/images/incorrect-dealer-id.png)

As you can see the function to request a Dealer ID has re-appeared below the error message. This is setup up to keep running until there is a correct input from the user.

### Display Previous Sales Data

If the user chose option a to view previous sales data and entered a valid dealer id the programme will tell the user the id was valid and display previous data if it exists in the Googlesheet and restart the programme:

![](docs/images/previous-sales-data-exists.png)

If no previous data exists the programme will tell the user there is no previous data for that dealer and restart the tool:

![](docs/images/no-previous-sales-data.png)

### User Input for Sales Data

If the user chose option b and enters a valid dealer id the programme tells the user it's a valid ID; pulls in the name of dealer from the dealer_details dealer worksheet in the Google sheet and requests sales data input from the user.

![](docs/images/enter-sales-data.png)

### Sales Data Validation

Once the user enters sales data into the input it validates whether the value entered is an integer or a float. If either of these validations are incorrect an error message is printed to the terminal and as with the Dealer ID input the sales data input function will continue to run until it passes validation. For example if the user enters text value by mistake:

![](docs/images/incorrect-sales-data.png)

### Calculating Dealer Pay, House Pay and Updating Worksheet

Once the user enters correct sales data the Sales Data Input stops running and the programme uses the user input to: 

* confirm sales data is valid
* calculate how much to pay the dealer
* print the amount to pay the dealer to the terminal
* calculate how much to pay the house
* print the amount to pay the house to the terminal
* print what is being updated in the dealer_details pay worksheet
* updates the worksheet
* print a confirmation of what data was added to the spreadsheet
* restarts the programme

![](docs/images/valid-sales-data.png)

## Future Features

* The ability to delete data from the pay worksheet
* The ability to remove or add new dealers
* The ability to enter more than one user ID and sales data at a time

# Data Models
I decided to use Google Sheets as my data model rather than storing data in data model classes. I felt this was more realistic for my imagined purpose as the imagined user is not a programmer. There is possibility with future development that I could take data from the Google Sheet and store that in classes. I would use this especially to be able to develop the functionality for multiple Dealer ID's and sales inputs.

I have used other objects as temporary data storage such as a dictionary to store the dealer name in a function. This dictionary is then used in the function to access dealer names across multiple functions.

I have also used pandas to create a dataframe to access and manipulated data when pulling previous sales data from the pay worksheet

# Testing

I have manually tested Pay Calculator in the following ways:

* Pass the code through PEP8 linter and confirmed there are no errors
* Inputted different types of incorrect data into the input fields, i.e. special characters, strings where there should have been integers, negative numbers in sales data, empty inputs etc. And have confirmed no unexpected error messages.
* Tested the programme in both my GitPod terminal and Code Institute instance of Heroku and the programme runs exactly as expected.

## Bugs

Solved bugs:

* Float error 1:

In my original function for getting sales data, I hadn't accounted for float values as sales - sales may not always be a integer. I was receiving errors such as:

![](docs/images/float-error.png)

To fix the issue I created a function to check and pass the value if it was a float or an integer and pass an error if it is not:

![](docs/images/sales-data-validation-function.png)

* Float error 2

Once I allowed floats to be passed into the programme, I then had to account for them in the functions that calculate dealer and house pay. I did this by getting the function to run a different sum based on int() and float() methods depending on which value was passed. For example in calculating dealer pay, I used the following:

## Remaining Bugs

* No known bugs outstanding in programme

## Validator Testing

I validated the code in PEP8 and no errors were returned:
